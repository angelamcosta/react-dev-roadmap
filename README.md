# React Mastery Journey 🚀

Welcome to my React Mastery Journey repository! This project follows the React Developer Roadmap from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) as a learning guide to deepen my understanding of React. Along the way, I'll be integrating Next.js and TypeScript to further expand my front-end development skills.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   React: The core library.
-   Next.js: A React framework.
-   TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript.

## 🎯 Goals

By the end of this journey, I aim to:

-   Have a solid understanding of modern React concepts and advanced patterns.
-   Be proficient in using Next.js for server-side rendering and building full-stack applications.
-   Write clean, maintainable code using TypeScript to enforce type safety.
